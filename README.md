# Zapier integration module
Zapier integration module exposes APIs for data synchronization with <a href="https://zapier.com" target="_blank">Zapier</a>.

Integration with Zapier allows VirtoCommerce solution to interchange data with outside systems through Zapier. The "New Customer" and "New Order" zapier triggers are currently available. That allows passing information about customers and orders to 3rd-party systems. A "New Customer" zapier action is also available, so that new customers can be imported automatically from the 3rd-party systems using Zapier Zap. In the future releases we plan to add more triggers and actions on demand.
